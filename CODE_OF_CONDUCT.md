# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Raspberry Claw project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

- **Be respectful** — different opinions and experiences are welcome.
- **Be constructive** — critique ideas, not people.
- **Be inclusive** — we aim to build a welcoming environment for newcomers and experienced contributors alike.

Unacceptable behavior includes: trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, public or private harassment, and publishing others’ private information without permission.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies in all project spaces (GitHub repos, issues, PRs, discussions) and in public communication when representing the project.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned with this code of conduct. Repeated or serious violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the project spaces.

## Contact

To report or discuss an incident, please open a private report to the maintainers (e.g. via GitHub or the contact channel indicated in the repository).
